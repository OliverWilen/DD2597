The project compiles like normal.

To run minix
qemu-system-i386 --enable-kvm -m 256 -hda minix_x86.img -nic user,model=virtio-net-pci
or to capture network traffic 
qemu-system-i386 --enable-kvm -m 256 -hda minix_x86.img -nic tap,model=virtio-net-pci

Login with root

Then setup network and restart network service using
netconf  #Enter 3 times to use default settings
service network restart

For each packet being sent, it should now be a print which writes the monitor
response for a invalid address and a valid address. The response for an invalid and valid 
responses should be -14 which is EFAULT and 0 for OK. 

As it is now we should see packets being sent out if we capture the traffic.
But if we comment out lines 341 and 342 in "minix/drivers/net/virtio_net/virtio_net.c"
the driver will instead use the invalid address and there should be no packets being sent.
